This project aims to automate the loan eligibility process for Dream Housing Finance company. The company deals in all kinds of home loans and has a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the loan status (approved or not approved) based on various customer details in the application form.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask for a real-time prediction API.
